Systems:

1. When creating Item objects in Level.cpp loadmap(), get the WeaponProperty object for the Weapon via a global map
2. (DONE) In level.cpp when parsing Item, fix the constructors so that they only take what is necessary and add rest in Pistol.cpp, Healthpack.cpp
3. Ressources cleanup, check if every new is followed by delete (Level class dtor..)
4. Bullet CTOR remove hitbox offset (hardcore in update function instead)
5. Bats smaller hitbox
6. Caret align wallhit at bot wall (PistolCaretUpRIGHT, PistolCaretUpLEFT)
7. Handle death animation of enemies (remove from items vector, clean up properly)

Gameplay/Design:

1. Background image for levels









WHAT TO DO BETTER:

- Animated Sprite -> Weapon -> Bullet(AnimatedSprite), Caret(AnimatedSprite)
->  one Weapon class
